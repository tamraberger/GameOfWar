# GameOfWarUpdate
This began as a homework assignment; the initial assignment was to pull two random cards from a deck and compare them. I ended up re-working the solution to play a full-length Game of War! This was probably the toughest project I have taken on yet, since building up a deck of cards and then playing a game with them requires you to go through 3 levels of interconnected classes.
